        <p>In the beginning of my 100 Days challenge, I was fortunate to have 
            ideas spontaneously pop into my head maybe 5/10 times. A few weeks 
            passed and as one would expect, the frequency of that happening 
            decreased more and more. These were some tactics I used to help me ideate:</p>

        <ul class="circle" type="circle">
            <li>Ex. prompt: “coffee”. What’s the process of making coffee? 
                What instruments are used to make coffee? What’s the process 
                of consuming coffee? Why do people drink coffee?

<h3>What I've learned and the mindset that has helped me through this process</h3>
<p>One of my main struggles with forming habits used to be trying to 
    make things perfect or over-exerting myself in the beginning. 
    At the beginning of these 100 days, I found myself trying to 
    come up with an idea 3 days in advance but once I became consciously 
    aware of my previous bad habits while trying to build good habits, 
    I was able to stop myself, realizing that it really just 
    defeats the purpose of my practice.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that <b>the point</b> is to <b>do something small each day</b> that I can 
    <b>incorporate into an existing routine</b>, and therefore, I’ll <b>gradually improve 
    without burning out</b>. I’ve also realized that it’s also <b>not about setting 
    goals</b>, which is what I’m used to hearing and doing, but it’s <b>actually 
    about the system</b>. It’s <b>the process</b> and <b>the act of makin</b>g that will give 
    me the results I want. Likewise, the product of my family practice doesn't 
    have to be perfect either. By focusing on the system instead, I’ll be less 
    likely to get discouraged and disappointed which has often led me to 
    break my habits in the past.</p>
<p>
    <b>Treating myself as a corporation</b>, as <b>an entity that is separate from <i>me</i></b>. 
    I find that because I usually care so much about the quality and outcome 
    of my projects, part of my resistance to accomplishing what I desire stems 
    from fear of disappointment. If I step outside of myself, however, and 
    <b>think objectively about my work</b>, not only is that pressure and fear lessened, 
    but I’ll also have a far better chance at improvement. This mindset also 
    helped me meet deadlines and accomplish my personal goals because it 
    would give me a more structured schedule. I would be less likely to 
    overwhelm myself and burn out while maintaining frequent mental and 
    physical checkups.
